# ChemBERTa Implementation Work Plan for BPC

## 1. Executive Summary
BPC seeks to improve how it represents molecules for downstream property prediction by adopting ChemBERTa — a machine learning model that generates chemical “fingerprints” from SMILES strings. This work plan outlines a modular, phased approach to integrating ChemBERTa into BPC’s existing infrastructure. The plan focuses on enhancing chemical screening accuracy while meeting regulatory standards, supporting future scalability, and enabling rapid internal experimentation.

# ChemBERTa Implementation Work Plan for BPC # 

## 1. Executive Summary ##
BPC seeks to improve how it represents molecules for downstream property prediction by adopting ChemBERTa — a machine learning model that generates chemical “fingerprints” from SMILES strings. This work plan outlines a modular, phased approach to integrating ChemBERTa into BPC’s existing infrastructure. The plan focuses on enhancing chemical screening accuracy while meeting regulatory standards, supporting future scalability, and enabling rapid internal experimentation.

## 2. Current State Analysis ##
Note: This section reflects the implementation team's best-practice assumptions based on typical pharmaceutical infrastructure and the prompt's statement that BPC has a "competent IT/cloud team but no prior experience with AI/ML workloads."

BPC has a capable IT and cloud infrastructure team but lacks hands-on experience with AI/ML systems. There is no prior deployment of transformer models, though standard cheminformatics tools (e.g., RDKit, KNIME) are in use. The organization has cloud resources provisioned (e.g., AWS/GCP) and data repositories available for molecular property data. However, no pipeline exists for self-supervised model training, fine-tuning, or scalable inference.

## 3. Project Objectives ##
*  Deploy ChemBERTa to generate chemical embeddings for property prediction
*  Integrate the model into existing chemical screening workflows
*  Establish MLOps practices for retraining, monitoring, and model versioning
*  Ensure compliance with pharma-specific regulations for model transparency and traceability

## 4. Technical Architecture Overview ## 

### Pipeline components: ###

*  Input Layer: SMILES strings are ingested from laboratory information management systems (LIMS), electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), or internal compound databases. Ingestion can be batch-based (CSV uploads) or API-driven (real-time).
*  Preprocessing: Molecules are validated for SMILES syntax, canonicalized using RDKit, and tokenized into substructures suitable for ChemBERTa. Preprocessing also includes deduplication, salt stripping, and charge normalization to ensure consistency across training and inference.
*  Embedding: The ChemBERTa model converts preprocessed SMILES into high-dimensional vector embeddings using a transformer-based architecture. Embeddings are computed using a fine-tuned model and cached for reuse. This component may run on GPU-enabled infrastructure for performance.
*  Prediction Module: The embeddings are fed into downstream models (e.g., fully connected neural networks, decision trees, or logistic regressors) to predict molecular properties such as solubility, toxicity, bioavailability, or target binding affinity. This module is modular and supports multiple property-specific heads.
*  MLOps Layer: Model deployment is managed through containerized APIs (e.g., FastAPI or Flask), tracked via MLflow or DVC, and version-controlled for auditability. CI/CD pipelines trigger deployments, while model drift is monitored using metrics dashboards (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana). Access control, encryption, and audit logging are included to meet pharma compliance needs.
