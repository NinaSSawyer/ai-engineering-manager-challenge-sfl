# Section 3 – Data Engineering Management

This section contains a modular, phased work plan for implementing ChemBERTa at a fictional pharma client (BPC).

## Contents

- `nina_sawyer_bpc_chemberta_workplan.pdf` – Statement document with executive summary, Gantt chart, cost table, and architecture diagram.

## Objective

Design a realistic roadmap to help BPC integrate ChemBERTa for molecular fingerprinting and downstream property prediction, considering:

- BPC’s lack of prior AI/ML experience
- Their existing IT/cloud team capabilities
- Real-world timeline, budget, and personnel constraints

## Deliverables

- Executive summary deck
- Defined phases, roles, tools, and costs
- Modularity for incremental implementation
